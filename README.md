## Description
This is a classic Snake game implemented in Python using "turtle" module. The game is coded using the PyCharm IDLE. The game allows players to control a snake that grows in length as it consumes food items. The main aim is to grow the snake as long as possible without colliding with the walls or itself.

## Features
1. Snake movement in four directions (Up, Down, Left, Right)
2. food items that spawn at random positions on the screen
3. Snake growth when eating food
4. Collision detection with the screen boundaries and the snake's body
5. Score and high score tracking and display

### How To Play
1. Install Python (if not already installed) from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/macos/)
2. Clone or download the repository to your local machine
3. Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory
4. Run the 'main.py' script using a Python interpreter
5. Use the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) to control the snake's direction
6. The snake will automatically move in the selected direction
7. Eat the food items to grow the snake and increase your score
8. The game ends when you stop the 'main' from running

### Dependencies
The snake game requires the 'turtle' module, which is included in the standard library of Python. 

### Acknowledgements
1. The game logic and inspiration were taken from classic Snake games
2. The [turtle module documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html) was used for implementing graphics and user input
